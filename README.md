# Rainfall-Prediction

## 1. Project Description

      .This is machine learning project to predict next-day rain by training classification 
        models on the target variable  RainTomorrow .

      .It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation ,and 
        deployment steps.

        . I make some EDA for good understanding to dataset.

       .The first challenge is to handle null values with the best way ,in this project i used             models to predict null values based on all feature exist in dataset i used  
        LinearRegression for numerical values ,and LogisticRegression for catigorical values.
         

        .the second challenge is to handel outlier i used a lot of techniques such as : IQR , 
         sqrt ,log transformation , BOX-COX , power transformation (you can search for them ) 
          then i finally used RobustScaler transformation .

         .
